An annotated corpus of argumentative microtexts
===============================================

The arg-microtexts corpus features 112 short argumentative texts. All texts
were originally written in German and have been professionally translated to
English.

The texts with ids b001-b064 and k001-k031 have been collected in a controlled
text generation experiment from 23 subjects discussing various controversial
issues from [a fixed list](topics_triggers.md).

The texts with ids d01-d23 have been written by Andreas Peldszus and were
used mainly in teaching and testing students argumentative analysis.

All texts are annotated with argumentation structures, following the scheme
proposed in Peldszus & Stede (2013). For inter-annotator-agreement scores see
Peldszus (2014). The (German) annotation guidelines are published in Peldszus, Warzecha, Stede (2016).
